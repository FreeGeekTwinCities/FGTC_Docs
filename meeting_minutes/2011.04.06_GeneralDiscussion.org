* <2011-04-06 Wed> General Discussion
  + Discussion of 1225 University space
    + "garage" spaces on "back" of building may be ideal main space
    + need to increase revenue to afford increased rent - may want to set up small store space (10x10?) first?
    + basement less appealing, but cheaper
    + Bricolage all over-16, would there be any problem with under-16 volunteers?
    + staffing and having store open 2-3 days/week should be high priority
** Recycling
   + Have credit with WM, may carry us through 1-2 pickups
** Garage Sale
