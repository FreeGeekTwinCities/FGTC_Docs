** Prospective Spaces
   + Per [[mailto:eddie@redesigninc.org][Eddie]] @ [[http://redesigninc.wordpress.com/][Seward Redesign]]: Franklin Ave. space likely out of our price range (once "triple net", shared costs, etc.)
   + Sisters' Camelot not zoned for (public) occupancy, so unsuitable for us (couldn't have volunteers)
   + No timeline for 816 space
   Other Prospects:

** Laser Recycling
   + IOT Inc. may want whole LaserWriters and/or toner cartridges for remanufacturing
