+ Need clearer demarcation between "ready for build" and "built" -- some machines seem to be "churned" through and re-built (unnecessarily)?
+ Move "problem" computers to beginning of bench, run through POST, etc.
+ For building, we need (and need to test)
     - Video
     - Keyboards
     - Mice
     - NICs
     - Memory
     - Hard Drives
     - Power Supplies
+ Owen/Ben having builds/testing on Sundays; 1-6 PM? Starting <2011-03-06 Sun>? Send notice/post to website?
+ Laptops
     - P3s: must be working, and have network (good for e.g. thin clients)
     - P4s: we'll do some troubleshooting
     - After 24 hours can get desktop *or* voucher for value of desktop?
+ Retention
     - Continuing incentives (discounts?) for ongoing volunteers
     - Need ongoing activity (8-10 hours per quarter?) to maintain discount
     - Cap on discounted purchases per quarter/year may be helpful ($200?)
