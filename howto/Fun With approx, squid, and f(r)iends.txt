All,

I spoke to Vagrant from FG in Portland and I asked how they have their deal setup for doing installs. He said that they don't use an apt-cache server, but instead use the methodology below because then that way they don't have to change the /etc/apt/sources.list on installs, and it finds the repos dynamically.

They also have their own repo for FG, which I've added to my own machine. We may want to do that because let's say we include videos, PDFs, documents etc with our systems, if we wanted to update those, all of our machines that went send out, could have a:

deb http://apt.freegeektwincities.org ubuntu fgtc main

in the /etc/apt/sources.list. (fgtc would be in place of the distro ala jaunty, karmic, etc, since these docs would not be release-specific like hardy, jaunty, karmic, etc)

Thoughts?

I know this is a ways off, so file this email under a "to look at in a couple of months from now" deal, but as we setup the network and do installs, we may want to do this if at all possible.
