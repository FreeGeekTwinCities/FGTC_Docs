* Is hardware reusable?
** Is is a computer (or a computer accessory)?
*** Is it clearly one of the items we DON'T accept (TV, non-mobile telephone)? -- if so, we can't accept it!
** If it's a computer, is it new (or nearly so)?
*** Check for a processor “badge”
**** New: Pentium 4, Centrino
**** Old: Pentium III, II, Pro...
**** Hard to tell: Athlon, Celeron
*** “Designed for Windows...”
**** New: XP, Vista
**** Older: ME, 2000
**** Oldest (probably recycle): 95, 98, NT
*** Check the ports on the back:
**** If it has USB, it's newer
**** Computers with NO round keyboard/mouse ports usually newest
*** If it's a Mac (has an Apple logo)
**** Beige = old, recycle it
**** Silver or colored: look for Firewire (house-shaped) ports
***** No Firewire = recycle
***** If it says G4 or G5, keep
** Monitors
*** Keep any LCDs (“flat-panel”) in elevator room
*** Take in CRTs, but '''$20 donation is mandatory!'''
**** Keep in garage
**** CRTs older than ~2000 or smaller than 15” are recycled automatically
**** Recycle extra CRTs by oldest/smallest
**** Keep “nice” CRTs
***** Sony/Trinitron
***** “flat-screen” (e.g. screen does not bulge out)
** If it's a peripheral (computer-related)
*** Keyboards -- check connectors
**** Keep: USB (flat) or PS/2 (small, round, often purple) connectors
**** Recycle: AT (large round)
*** Separate wireless keyboards/mice
*** Mice – check connector & look underneath
**** Keep USB and/or optical mice (those with lens underneath)
**** Recycle old (“ball”) mice
*** Network cards – keep “fast” Ethernet (usually has “10/100” light)
*** Modems (internal or external): recycle
*** Graphics cards: keep for now, unless obviously very old (then recycle with circuit boards)
*** Printers
**** Keep: laser printers, multi-function (scan/print)
**** Recycle: dot-matrix, inkjets WITHOUT USB
*** Scanners: keep for now

* If it's a reusable computer:
** Remove hard drives ASAP and lock up or DBAN (both at 3405 for now – take over or put in turquoise bins bound for 3405)
** Reusable hardware goes by “back” wall or in elevator room
* If hardware's not reusable...
** Recyclable hardware should be labeled (e.g. large black “R” in permanent marker)
*** Disassembled by new builders
*** Materials sorted
**** circuit boards go to MPC
**** plastics go to...
**** metal goes in box or out behind PPNA for pickup by...
* Receipts
** receipt book should be in cashbox
* Donations
** Donations are '''required''' for CRTs due to recycling costs
** All other donations are optional
** Suggested donations are posted on garage door
** Money goes in cash box
*** Should be on workbench
*** Ask a “keyholder” if it's locked!
