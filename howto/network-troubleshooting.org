* Build room computers can't fetch updates!

  This is usually due to a change in routing tables (by network-manager?) -- normally, if you type [[shell:route -n]], you should see a "default" route (at the bottom) like the following:

  =0.0.0.0         10.0.1.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0=

  However, this is sometimes changed to:

  =0.0.0.0         10.0.1.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0=

  To correct this:
  1. [[shell:sudo route del default]]
  2. [[shell:sudo route add default gw 10.0.1.1 wlan0]]
