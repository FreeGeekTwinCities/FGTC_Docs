* Getting Started
We use the [[http://tryton.org/][Tryton ERP system]] to manage internal information (or will, once [[mailto:brian@freegeektwincities.org][Brian]] gets his act together!)

The server component runs on a Dell PowerEdge server (located in the "server closet), and was installed via Python's easy_install script (since [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/trytond/][Tryton in PyPI]] is much more current than [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/tryton-server][Tryton in Ubuntu's repositories]] -- 1.8.2 vs. 1.4.3, as of <2011-03-15 Tue>!); however, since dependencies are largely unchanged from Tryton 1.4 to 1.8, supporting packages (e.g. python-lxml) are still best installed via dpkg/apt-get.

For clients (those who simply want to connect to the server), you can simply install Debian's tryton-client_1.8 package: [[http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/debian/pool/main/t/tryton-client/tryton-client_1.8.1-1_all.deb][http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/debian/pool/main/t/tryton-client/tryton-client_1.8.1-1_all.deb]]

   1. Install packaged dependencies for basic server:

      + python-dateutil
      + python-vatnumber
      + python-genshi (for report templates)
      + python-relatorio (and its dependency, python-lxml)
      + python-psycopg2 (for connecting to Postgres database)
      + postgresql (if you didn't install it initially!)
	
	Command line: =sudo apt-get install python-dateutil python-genshi python-relatorio python-psycopg2 python-vatnumber postgresql=

   2. Install python distutils (includes "easy_install")
      
	Command line: =sudo apt-get install python-setuptools=

   3. Install trytond
      
	Command line: =sudo easy_install trytond=

   4. Install modules (optional)

      Modules allow you to perform most of the functions in Tryton (e.g. tracking sales, printing invoices, entering timesheets, etc.), so you'll probably want at least /some/ of them -- a list of official modules can be obtained by searching PyPI for "tryton": [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=tryton]]

      For Free Geek purposes, the most important are probably:

      + *trytond-sale* (for tracking sales/adoptions)
      + *trytond-purchase* (for tracking purchases/expenses)
      + *trytond-timesheet* (for... well, timesheets!)
      + *trytond-account-ucoa* (our own module for tracking accounts in a way that /should/ ease IRS 990 filings - available from http://tryton-ucoa.googlecode.com)

	Command line: =sudo easy_install trytond_sale trytond_purchase trytond_timesheet=


   5. Set up Postgres database user -- use [[http://www.pgadmin.org/][pgAdmin]] GUI to create user with createdb permissions, or...

      Command line (from README.Debian): =sudo su - postgres -c "createuser --createdb --no-createrole --no-superuser --pwprompt tryton"=

   6. Edit /etc/trytond.conf -- default one is attached, or available from [[http://hg2.tryton.org/1.8/trytond/raw-file/default/etc/trytond.conf]]

   7. Copy attached tryton-server.init to /etc/init/tryton-server.d -- default file can be downloaded directly from [[http://git.debian-maintainers.org/?p=tryton/tryton-server.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/tryton-server.init;hb=HEAD]]
   
   8. Copy attached tryton-server.default to /etc/defaults/tryton-server (from [[http://git.debian-maintainers.org/?p=tryton/tryton-server.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/tryton-server.default;hb=HEAD]])

   9. Try starting your server -- either do [[shell:sudo trytond]] (better for troubleshooting) or just [[shell:sudo /etc/init.d/tryton-server start]] if you're feeling confident!
      
      If all goes well, you should see your modules getting registered, followed by:
      
	=INFO:server:starting NetRPC protocol, port 8070=
      
	=INFO:server:waiting for connections...=
